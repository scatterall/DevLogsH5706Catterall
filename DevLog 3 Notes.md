## Dev Log 3 Notes

### November 23

To remind myself - Dr. Graham helped me generate a metadata.csv. I'm a bit confused but it's helping us to organize the emails by DATE. So - that means we could do a plot by what was being said THAT DAY on a certain subject. I think?

Captain's Log: Today's objective is to try and scrub even more French words from the .csv file. I haven't tried starting a TF-IDF from the .csv file, but that's what I'm going to try. 
I had a list of 500 popular French words - I'm going to try scrubbing even more. After that, perhaps I'll have more luck generating the plots.

So RStudio would not open. I cleared up memory, restarted the computer, and eventually uninstalled and reinstalled it. After that, I could get it running. However, as I'm trying to run the TF-IDF tutorial, I'm now getting errors that there is no "Corpus" function, which is part of the "tm package", which I DID install (as part of the TFIDF code). So what did I screw up?

WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE FOR THINGS TO JUST WORK??? 

Okay well I feel like it was two steps forward, ALL THE WAY BACK. I think I've completely eff'd up my RStudio. Can't get it running in either desktop or cloud version. Dr. Graham has been so helpful as well and I honestly feel like this whole project is just me going in circles.
