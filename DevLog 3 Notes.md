## Dev Log 3 Notes

### November 23

To remind myself - Dr. Graham helped me generate a metadata.csv. I'm a bit confused but it's helping us to organize the emails by DATE. So - that means we could do a plot by what was being said THAT DAY on a certain subject. I think?

Captain's Log: Today's objective is to try and scrub even more French words from the .csv file. I haven't tried starting a TF-IDF from the .csv file, but that's what I'm going to try. 
I had a list of 500 popular French words - I'm going to try scrubbing even more. After that, perhaps I'll have more luck generating the plots.
