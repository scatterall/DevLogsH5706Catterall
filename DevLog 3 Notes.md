## Dev Log 3 Notes

### November 23
Captain's Log: Today's objective is to try and scrub even more French words from the .csv file. I haven't tried starting a TF-IDF from the .csv file, but that's what I'm going to try. 
I had a list of 500 popular French words - I'm going to try scrubbing even more. After that, perhaps I'll have more luck generating the plots.
